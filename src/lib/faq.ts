        question: "Is my degree still valuable with the new NEP 2020 policy?",
        answer: "Yes, but it needs to be supplemented. The National Education Policy (NEP 2020) now requires students to earn credits from skill-based courses. A traditional degree is no longer enough. Our programs provide these mandatory skills and official university credits to make your degree fully compliant and much more valuable to employers."
    },
    {
        question: "Are these credits official and will my university accept them?",
        answer: "Absolutely. All our programs are approved by RTMNU, a UGC-recognized public state university. The credits you earn are academically valid and designed to be part of your degree under the NEP framework. They are not just 'extra' courses; they are a formal part of your education."
