/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * allowing users to read and write their own profile data. Course data is publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores public course information.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, including enrolled courses.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Courses are publicly readable but not writable through the client.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `UserProfile` includes the `uid` field, which must match the `userId`
 *   in the document path (`/users/{userId}`). This denormalization is essential
 *   for security rules to verify user ownership.
