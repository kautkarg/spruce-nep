/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to both courses and inquiries collections. No write access is permitted through these rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read-only access for all users (including unauthenticated users) to courses and inquiries.
 * - No write operations are allowed through these rules.
