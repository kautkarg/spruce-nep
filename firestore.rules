/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to course and inquiry data, as per the application's design where all data is considered open access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores information about each course.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries related to the courses.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No write operations are permitted through these rules.
 * - Public read access (get, list) is enabled for both courses and inquiries.
