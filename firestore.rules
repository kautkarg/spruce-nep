/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows open read access to both courses and inquiries.
 * No write permissions are granted, reflecting the read-only nature of the data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to all collections.
 * - Write access is completely disabled to prevent unauthorized modifications.
