/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Spruce Life Skills.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data ownership and prevents unauthorized access to enrollments.
 * It allows public read access to courses and inquiries, but restricts writes to authorized users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information. Publicly readable.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only accessible by the user.
 * - /enrollments/{enrollmentId}: Stores enrollment records. Only accessible by the enrolled user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, update, or delete their own user profiles.
 * - Users can create enrollments only for themselves.
 * - Listing of enrollments and users is disallowed to prevent data scraping.
 * - Courses and Inquiries are publicly readable to allow for easy discovery and contact.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Enrollment` document requires a `userId` field that must match the authenticated user's UID
 *   to authorize write operations. This avoids costly `get()` calls.
