/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to both courses and inquiries, as
 * all data is considered public. Write access is disallowed to all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores information about courses.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All users, including unauthenticated users, can read courses and inquiries.
 * - No Write Access: No users can create, update, or delete courses or inquiries.
