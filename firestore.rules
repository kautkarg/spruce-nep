/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access to courses and allows anyone to submit inquiries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Publicly readable course data.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: User-submitted inquiries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Courses are publicly readable (get, list).
 * - Inquiries can be created by anyone, but data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase.
