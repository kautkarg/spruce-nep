/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Spruce Life Skills.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a hybrid security model. User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * Courses and Enrollments are publicly readable but only writable by authenticated users.
 * Inquiries are also publicly readable but only writable by authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, secured by user ID.
 * - /enrollments/{enrollmentId}: Stores enrollment data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Anyone can read courses, inquiries, and enrollments.
 * - Only authenticated users can create courses, inquiries, and enrollments.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * No denormalization is currently used but may be added later if needed for performance.
 * For example, adding a 'members' map to courses to manage collaborators.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * No structural segregation is applied in this version.
