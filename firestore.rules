 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset makes course data publicly readable. As user authentication
 * has been removed, there are no user-specific rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores public course information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Course data is public for reading.
 * - No client-side writes are allowed to prevent tampering.
