/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SpruceConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to both courses and inquiries, as
 * all data is considered non-sensitive and intended for open consumption.
 * All write operations are disallowed, reflecting a read-only data model for this application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores information about each course.
 * - /inquiries/{inquiryId}: Stores user inquiries related to the courses.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for all data.
 * - No write access granted to any user.
 * - No specific validation is enforced, given the read-only nature of the rules.
