    "reasoning": "This Firestore data structure is designed to support the SpruceConnect application, focusing on courses and user inquiries. It prioritizes simplicity, security, and scalability. Since all data is public, no special access control is necessary.\n\n*   **Courses Collection:** Stores information about each course. This allows easy retrieval and display of course details in the app's course catalog.\n*   **Inquiries Collection:** Stores user inquiries related to the courses. This helps to manage and respond to user requests efficiently.\n\nAuthorization Independence (N/A): Since there are no write permissions necessary, authorization independence is irrelevant. The course and inquiry data is considered open access.\n\nQAPs Support (List operations): The structure supports listing all courses and inquiries without complex filtering. This is because all documents in each collection share the same security posture."
